# ISS Live ScreenSaver


A Mac OS X screensaver with live [footage from the International Space Station](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iss-hdev-payload).

Notes from the Ustream Channel:

**Black Image = International Space Station (ISS) is on the night side of the Earth.**
**Gray Image = Switching between cameras, or communications with the ISS is not available.**
**No Audio = Normal. There is no audio on purpose. Add your own soundtrack.**

The above means that you will have a black or grey screen for ~45 minutes since ISS makes a full orbit every 90 minutes (=45 sunsine, 45 night). But the sunsets are magnificent up there..


## Instructions

You can grab the [Release/ISS Screensaver.saver](https://github.com/Diolor/ISS-Live-ScreenSaver/raw/master/Release/ISS Screensaver.saver) and simply install it.

## TODO:

Posibibly add a map with the location of the ISS as shown on the second map on [this page](http://iss.astroviewer.net/). Feel free to push your requests.
